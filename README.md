This is an application for Enrolling users in a Event.
This is specifically designed for an event at Syracuse University.

Features:

To retrieve the file, you can manually choose the data to download from the sandbox.
The procedure for manually downloading the sandbox is below:
  1. Open Xcode.
  2. Click on Window-> Devices.
  3. Once the Device tab is opened.
  4. Click on the application.
  5. Click on the Settings icon.
  6. Click on the "Download Container".
  7. Save the file to a location.
  8. Right Click on the file and click the "Show Package Contents" option.
  9. Navigate to appdata-> documents->"here is the CSV file that is stored."
  
  
The above steps can be replaced with downloading the file / Emailing or through Share option.
